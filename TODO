* Add a QPushButton on the right part of the WordFrame. (Factorize the existing ones in QuestionFrame and AnswerFrame)
* Align the big characters of the AnswerFrame to the right
* Allow editing the 'pronunciation' field when adding a word
* App mustn't crash when clicking on "Back to test" from add frame.
* Ensure that every time an object is created with "new", either it has never been defined before, or it has been deleted with "delete". Either way there'll be memory leaks.
* Understand why some "delete" make the app crash
* Color the edit field in green or red when right or wrong and color those messages too
* Change font sizes, especially the word being asked
* Set a default window width (?)
* Create app icon
* Edit existing entries to get them all clean and available for tests
