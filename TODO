* Ensure that every time an object is created with "new", either it has never been defined before, or it has been deleted with "delete". Either way there'll be memory leaks.
* Understand why some "delete" make the app crash
* Color the edit field in green or red when right or wrong and color those messages too
* Change font sizes
* Set a default window width
* Create app icon
* Edit existing entries to get them all clean and available for tests
* Solve encoding issues

To avoid many 'delete' crashes and memory leak problems, I found out it was efficient to use the technique of always ensuring that every attribute is instancied by allocating resources from the first time (even if widget is not already in use)and deleting and re-creating it each time we want a new widget.
