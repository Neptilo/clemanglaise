To do first (because very useful):
==================================
* Create app icon: My idea is to represent a nice chocolate cake with cr√®me anglaise spilling on it, like this: 
  http://www.howdoyousaythatword.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/creme-anglaise.jpg, use a vector graphics editor.
To do next:
===========

* App mustn't crash when clicking on ``Add new word`` while the asked word is still loading.
* Treat all cases when there is no Internet connection.
* Ensure that every time an object is created with ``new``, either it has never been defined before, or it has been deleted with ``delete``. Either way there'll be memory leaks.
* Understand why some ``delete`` make the app crash
* Change font sizes, especially the word being asked
* Set a default window width (?)
