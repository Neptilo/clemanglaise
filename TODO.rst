* Create app icon: My idea is to represent a nice chocolate cake with crème anglaise spilling on it, like this: 
  http://www.howdoyousaythatword.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/creme-anglaise.jpg, use a vector graphics editor.
* Treat all cases when there is no Internet connection.
* Change font sizes, especially the word being asked
* Set a default window width (?)
* Improve ergonomy: allow to do everything using the keyboard only.
  * An "OK" button should always be pressable with the Enter key or Ctrl+Enter if there is an ambiguity.
  * A "Cancel" or "Go back" button should always be pressable with the Esc key.
  * All the modifiable widgets should be accessible with Tab.
* Improve search:
  * Develop a search string as multiple search strings with different functions applied to them: for example in Chinese, develop a search "ma3" into a search for "mǎ", develop a search "ma" into searches for "mā", "má", "mǎ", "mà".
  * Allow searches for multiple strings at a time
  * Highlight matched strings
* Instead of increasing or descreasing a score when an answer is right or wrong, increase two variables in different fields of the table, and update a score field as the percentage of correct answers. The app will then still ask for the words with the lowest scores.
  Then the words asked are no longer the ones that have been reviewed a long time ago, but the ones that are answered the most frequently wrong.
* Publicly release the app with an installer
* Include a field for the gender in German
